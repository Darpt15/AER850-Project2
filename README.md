# AER850-Project2
 mage recognition has become a critical advancement within Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly for tasks requiring automated visual inspection in aerospace engineering. In aircraft maintenance, regular inspections are necessary to identify and address issues such as cracks, missing screws, and surface degradation, all of which are critical for the safety and longevity of the aircraft structure. In this project, you will focus on a dataset containing images of aircraft skin defects, in- cluding cracks, missing screw heads, and paint degradation. These defects need to be iden- tified early to prevent further damage and ensure the structural integrity of the aircraft. In real-world applications, automating the detection of such defects using Deep Convolu- tional Neural Networks (DCNNs) would enhance both efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional manual inspection methods. You are tasked with building a DCNN model that can classify these defects into their re- spective categories. This project will involve data processing, designing neural network ar- chitectures, hyperparameter tuning, evaluating model performance, and testing the model on unseen images.
